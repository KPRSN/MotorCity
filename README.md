An experiment in traffic simulation and path finding using SFML.
Path finding is based upon the A* algorithm to find vehicle routes, and vehicle behaviour rely solely on following routes and direct blocking. 

Due to the lack of prediction, deadlock might occur between cars waiting for each other going in and out of a driveway.
